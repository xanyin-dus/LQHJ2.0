# Git Practice Repository 

## 1. Project Description 

This repository is dedicated to the team's Git learning and practice. It carries no actual business value and is intended to help members get familiar with basic Git operations, with a focus on the workflows of branch creation, commit, and push.

## 2. Purpose 

- Master core commands for Git branch operations. 

- Get acquainted with the process of synchronizing local branches to remote repositories. 

- Learn to resolve common issues in daily Git use (e.g., permission errors, simple conflicts). 

## 3. Core Practice Task 

The primary task is **Git Branch Creation & Push**. Please follow the steps below (consistent with the team's demo): 

### 3.1 Operation Steps 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine 
   `git clone [Repository URL]`

2. Create a new local branch 
   `git checkout -b [Custom Branch Name]` (Suggested naming: `practice-username`, e.g., `practice-zhangsan`)

3. Make arbitrary modifications 
   You may create test files, edit this README, etc. Content rationality is not required. 

4. Commit changes to the local repository 
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "Commit Message (mark practice purpose)"` (e.g., `git commit -m "practice: test branch push"`)

5. Push the local branch to the remote repository 
   `git push -u origin [Custom Branch Name]`

## 4. Notes 

- This repository is for practice only. There is no need to follow formal project specifications for commits or branches; the priority is to proficiently grasp the operation process. 

- Ensure your branch name is unique and recognizable to avoid confusion with others' branches. 

- If you encounter errors (e.g., permission denied, branch conflicts), discuss with the team or refer to the official Git documentation for troubleshooting. 

- Do not delete branches after practice; keep them as records of your operations. 

## 5. Supplementary Information 

Subsequent Git practice tasks (e.g., branch merging, version rollback) will be conducted in this repository, and relevant requirements will be notified promptly. 

Wish you a smooth practice and quick mastery of Git skills!
